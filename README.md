# Cars Data EDA and Modelling
 
# Dataset

In this part, you will use the car evaluation database, which was  derived from a simple hierarchical decision model. (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).

The model uses six attributes:

*   buying: Car Buying Price. This attribute has four values: vhigh, high, med, low.
*   maint: Price of the Maintenance.  This attribute has four values: vhigh, high, med, low.
*   doors: Number of Doors. This attribute has four values: 2, 3, 4, 5-more.
*   persons: Capacity in terms of persons to carry. This attribute has three values: 2, 4, more.
*   lug_boot: The Size of Luggage Boot. This attribute has three values: small, med, big.
*   safety: Estimated Safety of the Car. This attribute has three values: low, med, high.

Using the above attributes, it is required to use a decision tree to evalute the car into one of the given values:


*   unacc: Unacceptable
*   acc: Acceptable
*   good: Good
*   vgood: Very Good
